ASP.NET Identity: Implementing Group-Based Permissions
======================================================

This is an example project to accompany a blog post describing how to extend the ASP.NET MVC 5 Identity system and implement a Group-based permission scheme. Users belong to Groups, and Groups have sets of authorization permissions to exxecute code within the application (using [Authorize]). The article can be found at [ASP.NET MVC 5 Identity: Implementing Group-Based Permissions Management Part I][4]

This project builds upon the foundation created by another example, [ASP.NET Identity: Extending Identity Roles][3], covered in the article [Extending Identity Accounts and Implementing Role-Based Authentication in ASP.NET MVC 5][1]. You can see in the commit history the basic steps taken to move from the previous project structure to one with a basic, but flexible Group-based security model. 

You may need to enable Nuget Package Restore in Visual Studio in order to download and restore Nuget packages during build. If you are not sure how to do this, see [Keep Nuget Packages Out of Source Control with Nuget Package Manager Restore][2] Apparrently, this is supposedly not required with Nuget anymore, but in case you need to . . .

You will also need to run Entity Framework Migrations `Update-Database` command per the article. The migration files are included in the repo, so you will NOT need to `Enable-Migrations` or run `Add-Migration Init`.

## Getting Started 
After you've cloned the project, go ahead and restore the NuGet Packages from the solution or console. Then run the project. 
You'll be able to log in and administer the groups and roles as well as users with the "test@test.com" user.
